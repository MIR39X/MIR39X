# 💫 About Me:
I am Arsalan Mir, a Cybersecurity student at FAST NUCES with a passion for deconstructing how systems connect. My approach to technology is purely driven by utility and curiosity: I identify a need, learn the necessary stack, build the solution, and then integrate it into my daily workflow. Currently, I am deep-diving into the world of Networking, aiming to master the intricacies of data flow and infrastructure. Whether I'm building custom apps to solve personal bottlenecks or exploring the latest in security protocols, I thrive on the cycle of turning 'not knowing' into 'having built it.
